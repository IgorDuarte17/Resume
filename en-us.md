## About me
Well, my name is Igor,
I am a Full Stack Web Developer, attending the 8th semester of System Information at ULBRA University and a good nerd.

I contribute to the community by writing some articles in [Medium](https://medium.com/@igorsantos17) and doing some talks and talks.  
Enthusiast of PHP, active member of the community and one of the [PHPRS](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/PHP-RS/) coordinators.

I have experience in the development and analysis of web solutions.
I have worked on several projects using various technologies such as PHP, C # .NET and Node.js.  
I have great flexibility in exchanging technologies and I understand them quickly, due to the high turnover of projects in which I participate.
As a good enthusiast of PHP I spend a lot of time studying about it and its tools.  

I also spent some time studying new technologies.
During free time, watch a show or play a game !!
